“The Death Eaters can’t all be pure-blood, there aren’t enough pure-blood wizards left,” said Hermione stubbornly. “I expect most of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. It’s only Muggle-borns they hate, they’d be quite happy to let you and Ron join up.”

Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it — it sounded a bit like an owl.

There was a large jar of Fleetwood’s High-Finish Handle Polish, a pair of gleaming silver Tail-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to clip on your broom for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare. 
Apart from his friends, the thing that Harry missed most about Hogwarts was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world — highly dangerous, very exciting, and played on broomsticks. Harry happened to be a very good Quidditch player; he had been the youngest person in a century to be picked for one of the Hogwarts House teams. One of Harry’s most prized possessions was his Nimbus Two Thousand racing broom.

Harry had. Mrs. Weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the Gryffindor lion knitted on the front, also a dozen home-baked mince pies, some Christmas cake, and a box of nut brittle. As he moved all these things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying underneath.

How come I haven’t got one?”
“Harry,” said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought. “Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I’ve heard you’ve bin givin’ out signed photos. How come I haven’t got one?”
“Harry,” said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden thought.
Furious, Harry wrenched his teeth apart.
“I have not been giving out signed photos,” he said hotly.
But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing.
“I’m on’y jokin’,” he said, patting Harry genially on the back and sending him face first into the table.
“Bet he didn’t like that,” said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his chin.
“Don’ think he did,” said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling.
“No thanks,” said Ron weakly.
“Come an’ see what I’ve bin growin’,” said Hagrid as Harry and Hermione finished the last of their tea.
In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid ’s house were a dozen of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen.
“Gettin’ on well, aren’t they?” said Hagrid happily.
“No thanks,” said Ron weakly.

And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own palms — Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
“Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched Voldemort.

he couldn’t see — he could only hear Quirrell’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in Harry’s own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!”
He felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell into blackness, down ... down ... down

transfiguration
Professor McGonagall’s classes were always hard work, but today was especially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer. He was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed to do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand. 
Ron was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wand with some borrowed Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and every time Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one. Professor McGonagall wasn’t pleased.

“Exams?” howled Seamus Finnigan. “We’re still getting exams?”

Harry chose a seat right at the back of the room, feeling as though he were sitting in a very bright spotlight; the rest of the class kept shooting furtive glances at him, as though he were about to drop dead at any moment. He hardly heard what Professor McGonagall was telling them about Animagi (wizards who could transform at will into animals), and wasn’t even watching when she transformed herself in front of their eyes into a tabby cat with spectacle markings around her eyes. 
“You are now entering a most important phase of your magical education!” she told them, her eyes glinting dangerously behind her square spectacles. “Your Ordinary Wizarding Levels are drawing closer — ”

“Now then, now then, now then,” said Slughorn, whose massive outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors. “Scales out, everyone, and potion kits, and don’t forget your copies of Advanced Potion-Making. ...” 
“Sir?” said Harry, raising his hand.

“I haven’t got a book or scales or anything — nor’s Ron — we didn’t realize we’d be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see — ” 
“Ah, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention ... not to worry, my dear boy, not to worry at all. You can use ingredients from the store cupboard today, and I’m sure we can lend you some scales, and we’ve got a small stock of old books here, they’ll do until you can write to Flourish and Blotts. ...” 
Slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after a moment’s foraging, emerged with two very battered- looking copies of Advanced Potion-Making by Libatius Borage, which he gave to Harry and Ron along with two sets of tarnished scales. 
“Now then,” said Slughorn, returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his waistcoat threatened to burst off, “I’ve prepared a few potions for you to have a look at, just out of interest, you know. These are the kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of ’em, even if you haven’t made ’em yet. Anyone tell me what this one is?” 
Anyone tell me what this one is?” 
Anyone tell me what this one is
He indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. Harry raised himself slightly in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it. 
Hermione’s well-practiced hand hit the air before anybody else’s; Slughorn pointed at her. 
“It’s Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion that forces the drinker to tell the truth,” said Hermione. 
“Very good, very good!” said Slughorn happily. “Now,” he continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, “this one here is pretty well known. ... Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too ... Who can — ?” 
“Very good, very good!” said Slughorn happily. “Now,” he continued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, “this one here is pretty well known. ... Featured in a few Ministry leaflets lately too ... Who can — ?”

Hermione’s hand was fastest once more. 
“It’s Polyjuice Potion, sir,” she said. 
Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance in the second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the credit for answering the question; she, after all, was the one who had succeeded in making it, back in their second year. 
“Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here ... yes, my dear?” said Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, as Hermione’s hand punched the air again. 
as Hermione’s hand punched the air again. 
“It’s Amortentia!” 
“It is indeed. It seems almost foolish to ask,” said Slughorn, who was looking mightily impressed, “but I assume you know what it does?” 
“It is indeed. It seems almost foolish to ask,” said Slughorn, who was looking mightily impressed, 
“It’s the most powerful love potion in the world!” said Hermione. 
“Quite right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its distinctive mother-of-pearl sheen?”

“And the steam rising in characteristic spirals,” said Hermione enthusiastically, “and it’s supposed to smell differently to each of us, according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and — ” 
But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence. 
“May I ask your name, my dear?” said Slughorn, ignoring Hermione’s embarrassment. 
“May I ask your name, my dear?” said Slughorn
“May I ask your name, my dear?”

“Hermione Granger, sir.” 
“Granger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth-Granger, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?” 
Granger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to Hector Dagworth-Granger, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society of Potioneers?
No, I don’t think so, sir. I’m Muggle-born, you see
Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something; both of them sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the contrary, he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry, who was sitting next to her. 
Oho! ‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in our yeah’ I’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, Harry?

Wormtail beckoned Frank into the room. Though still deeply shaken, Frank took a firmer grip upon his walking stick and limped over the threshold.
The fire was the only source of light in the room; it cast long, spidery shadows upon the walls. Frank stared at the back of the armchair; the man inside it seemed to be even smaller than his servant, for Frank couldn’t even see the back of his head.

“Please, sir,” said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, “the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout of the werewolf — ”
  “That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger,” said Snape coolly. “Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all.”
“Anyone?” Snape said, ignoring Hermione. His twisted smile was back. “Are you telling me that Professor Lupin hasn’t even taught you the basic distinction between — ”

“I say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the countryside. Once we’re there, we could send a message to the Order.” 
“Can you do that talking Patronus thing, then?” asked Ron. 
Alphard
“Can you do that talking Patronus thing, then?
“I’ve been practicing and I think so,” said Hermione. 
“Well, as long as it doesn’t get them into trouble, though they might’ve been arrested already. God, that’s revolting,” Ron added after one sip of the foamy, grayish coffee. The waitress had heard; she shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers’ orders. The larger of the two workmen, who was blond and quite huge, now that Harry came to look at him, waved her away. She stared, affronted. 
“Let’s get going, then, I don’t want to drink this muck,” said Ron. “Hermione, have you got Muggle money to pay for this?” 
“Let’s get going, then, I don’t want to drink this muck,” said Ron.
“Yes, I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to the Burrow. I’ll bet all the change is at the bottom,” sighed Hermione, reaching for her beaded bag. 
The two workmen made identical movements, and Harry mirrored them without conscious thought: All three of them drew their wands. Ron, a few seconds late in realizing what was going on, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways onto her bench. 
The force of the Death Eaters’ spells shattered the tiled wall where Ron’s head had just been, as Harry, still invisible, yelled, “Stupefy!” 
His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired another at Ron: Shining black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound Ron head to foot — the waitress screamed and ran for the door — Harry sent another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the waitress, who collapsed in front of the door. 
“Expulso!” bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which Harry was standing blew up: The force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the Cloak slipped off him. 
“Petrificus Totalus!’ screamed Hermione from out of sight, and the Death Eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china, table, and coffee. Hermione crawled out from underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and trembling all over. 
“D-diffindo,” she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who roared in pain as she slashed open the knee of his jeans, leaving a deep cut. “Oh, I’m so sorry, Ron, my hand’s shaking! Diffindo!”

Voldemort raised his wand. The tortured Death Eater lay flat upon the ground, gasping. 
The Death Eater on the ground writhed and shrieked; Harry was sure the sound must carry to the houses around. ... Let the police come, he thought desperately ... anyone ... anything ... 
“ Cruciol ” 
Voldemort began to laugh. He raised his wand.

 Dean had won himself a wand, for he was face-to-face with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry, Ron, and Hermione raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were weaving and darting around so much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting one of their own side if they cast curses. Even as they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great “Wheeeeeeeeeeee,” and, looking up, Harry saw Peeves zooming over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms. 
“Argh!” 
A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron’s head; the slimy green roots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to shake them loose. 
“Someone’s invisible there!” shouted a masked Death Eater, pointing.

The sky outside the window was ruby-red; it seemed to be sunset. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his thumbs, watching the door. 
The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked past Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains at his window.

Slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk as the boys filed out. Voldemort, however, stayed behind. Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately, wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn.
“Good gracious, is it that time already?” said Slughorn. “You’d better get going, boys, or we’ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by tomorrow or it’s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.”

A curly-haired third-year Hufflepuff girl to whom Harry had never spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very next day. Harry was so taken aback he said no before he’d even stopped to consider the matter. The girl walked off looking rather hurt, and Harry had to endure Dean’s, Seamus’s, and Ron’s taunts about her all through History of Magic. The following day, two more girls asked him, a second year and (to his horror) a fifth year who looked as though she might knock him out if he refused.

"The multiple staircases in the Grand Staircase lead from platform to platform and go as high as the seventh floor where they come to an end. The stairs also have a knack for moving around the staircase chamber, usually when a student is walking up one of them. It was Rowena Ravenclaw who came up with the idea of using moving stairs."

So that’s the heading of our manifesto.”
She brandished the sheaf of parchment at them.
“I’ve been researching it thoroughly in the library. Elf enslavement goes back centuries. I can’t believe no one’s done anything about it before now.”
“Hermione — open your ears,” said Ron loudly. “They. Like. It. They like being enslaved!”
“Our short-term aims,” said Hermione, speaking even more loudly than Ron, and acting as though she hadn’t heard a word, “are to secure house-elves fair wages and working conditions. Our long-term aims include changing the law about non-wand use, and trying to get an elf into the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, because they’re shockingly underrepresented.”
“And how do we do all this?” Harry asked.
And how do we do all this?
“We start by recruiting members,” said Hermione happily. “I thought two Sickles to join — that buys a badge — and the proceeds can fund our leaflet campaign. You’re treasurer, Ron — I’ve got you a collecting tin upstairs — and Harry, you’re secretary, so you might want to write down everything I’m saying now, as a record of our first meeting.”

Snape’s uneven, yellowish teeth were bared.
I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father, Potter
Harry bit his lip
Or did he consider the details 
And did the headmaster 
Snape’s sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk.
I told you to shut up about my dad!
What did you say to me, Potter

approached the giants
“Extend them the hand of friendship, now, before it is too late,” said Dumbledore, “or Voldemort will persuade them, as he did before, that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom!” 
“Envoys to the giants?” Fudge shrieked, finding his tongue again. “What madness is this?” 
“Envoys to the giants?” Fudge shrieked, finding his tongue again. “What madness is this?” 
“Envoys to the giants?” Fudge shrieked, finding his tongue again
Fudge shrieked, finding his tongue again
“The second step you must take — and at once,” Dumbledore pressed on, “is to send envoys to the giants.” 
Fudge was opening and closing his mouth as though no words could express his outrage. 
“The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds, Cornelius, knowing that you have put Lord Voldemort’s most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them!” said Dumbledore. “They will not remain loyal to you, Fudge! Voldemort can offer them much more scope for their powers and their pleasures than you can! With the dementors behind him, and his old supporters returned to him, you will be hard-pressed to stop him regaining the sort of power he had thirteen years ago!” 
“Preposterous!” shouted Fudge again. “Remove the dementors? I’d be kicked out of office for suggesting it! Half of us only feel safe in our beds at night because we know the dementors are standing guard at Azkaban!” 
“Voldemort has returned,” Dumbledore repeated. “If you accept that fact straightaway, Fudge, and take the necessary measures, we may still be able to save the situation. The first and most essential step is to remove Azkaban from the control of the dementors — ” 
seven thirteen
Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He had always thought of Fudge as a kindly figure, a little blustering, a little pompous, but essentially good- natured. But now a short, angry wizard stood before him, refusing, point-blank, to accept the prospect of disruption in his comfortable and ordered world — to believe that Voldemort could have risen. 
118
“I see no evidence to the contrary!” shouted Fudge, now matching her anger, his face purpling. “It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years!” 
118
“You fool!” Professor McGonagall cried. “Cedric Diggory! Mr. Crouch! These deaths were not the random work of a lunatic!” 
page 118
“You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being Death Eaters thirteen years ago!” said Fudge angrily. “You could have found those names in old reports of the trials! For heaven’s sake, Dumbledore — the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too — his tales are getting taller, and you’re still swallowing them — the boy can talk to snakes, Dumbledore, and you still think he’s trustworthy?” 
“You are merely repeating the names of those who were acquitted of being Death Eaters thirteen years ago!” said Fudge angrily. “You could have found those names in old reports of the trials! For heaven’s sake, Dumbledore — the boy was full of some crackpot story at the end of last year too — his tales are getting taller, and you’re still swallowing them — the boy can talk to snakes
“Avery — Nott — Crabbe — Goyle — ” 
“Also cleared! Now working for the Ministry!” 
“Macnair!” Harry continued. 
“Malfoy was cleared!” said Fudge, visibly affronted. “A very old family — donations to excellent causes — ” 
Snape made a sudden movement, but as Harry looked at him, Snape’s eyes flew back to Fudge. 
He tried to get out of bed again, but Mrs. Weasley forced him back. “I saw the Death Eaters! I can give you their names! Lucius Malfoy — ”

“Look, I saw Voldemort come back!” Harry shouted. 
“You’ll forgive me, Dumbledore, but I’ve never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before. ...” 
Fudge had taken half a step back from Dumbledore, but he looked no less stubborn.

no arguements
no arguments
He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.
They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.
“Shake ’em off ... shake ’em off,” he would mutter whenever he did this.

The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.

There was a pause. Then — The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.
A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all the hair.

“Yes, yes, I will,” said Lupin. 
“I made an entire cauldronful,” Snape continued. “If you need more.” 
“I should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks very much, Severus.” 
“Not at all,” said Snape, but there was a look in his eye Harry didn’t like. He backed out of the room, unsmiling and watchful. 
Harry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled. 
“Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me,” he said. “I have never been much of a potion- brewer and this one is particularly complex.” He picked up the goblet and sniffed it. “Pity sugar makes it useless,” he added, taking a sip and shuddering. 
“Why — ?” Harry began. Lupin looked at him and answered the unfinished question.

Harry released Neville, though he was unaware of doing so. 
The laughter had not quite died from his face, but his eyes widened in shock.
The second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest.

He could not finish; it was only now that Ron was here again that Harry fully realized how much his absence had cost them.
“After you left,” he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron’s face was hidden, “she cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn’t want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other. With you gone ...”
The sword clanged as Ron dropped it. He had sunk to his knees, his head in his arms. He was shaking, but not, Harry realized, from cold. Harry crammed the broken locket into his pocket, knelt down beside Ron, and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder. He took it as a good sign that Ron did not throw it off.
Harry stooped, pretending he had not seen, and picked up the broken Horcrux. Ron had pierced the glass in both windows: Riddle’s eyes were gone, and the stained silk lining of the locket was smoking slightly. The thing that had lived in the Horcrux had vanished; torturing Ron had been its final act.

Harry, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, emerged into the sunlight outside Honeydukes and prodded Ron in the back.
"Hogwarts?" he said abruptly. “Come to get your new books?”
Buckbeak pawed the ground, tossing his sharp head.
"Azkaban must be terrible," Harry muttered. Lupin nodded grimly.

“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose — only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — oh no ...”
The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed that Harry’s broom was behaving strangely It was carrying him slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it went.
“Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing,” Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. “If I didn’ know better, I’d say he’d lost control of his broom ... but he can’t have. ...”
Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands. His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry’s broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling from it, holding on with only one hand.

“You’re dead, Harry Potter,” said Riddle’s voice above him. “Dead. Even Dumbledore’s bird knows it. Do you see what he’s doing, Potter? He’s crying.”
He could hear echoing footsteps and then a dark shadow moved in front of him.
“Fawkes,” said Harry thickly. “You were fantastic, Fawkes. ...” He felt the bird lay its beautiful head on the spot where the serpent’s fang had pierced him.
A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of claws beside him.
Harry slid down the wall. He gripped the fang that was spreading poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he knew it was too late. White- hot pain was spreading slowly and steadily from the wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched his own blood soaking his robes, his vision went foggy. The Chamber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color.

Dear Harry, Ron, and Hermione, Aragog died last night Harry and Ron, you met him, and you know how special he was. Hermione, I know you’d have liked him. It would mean a lot to me if you’d nip down for the burial later this evening. I’m planning on doing it round dusk, that was his favorite time of day. I know you’re not supposed to be out that late, but you can use the cloak. Wouldn’t ask, but I can’t face it alone.

A warmth was spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight; a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving.  He knew that Ron and Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell them. 
Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.

“My Lord, I must speak!” said Wormtail, panic in his voice now. “All through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head — My Lord, Bertha Jorkins’s disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if we proceed, if I murder — ”   “IP” whispered the second voice. “If? If you follow the plan, Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that anyone else has died. You will do it quietly and without fuss; I only wish that I could do it myself, but in my present condition ... Come, Wormtail, one more death and our path to Harry Potter is clear. I am not asking you to do it alone. By that time, my faithful servant will have rejoined us — ”   “I am a faithful servant,” said Wormtail, the merest trace of sullenness in his voice.

"And lastly, while you stay here, the Burrow has been given the highest  security the Ministry of Magic can provide. These measures have caused a  certain amount of inconvenience to Arthur and Molly -- all their post, for  instance, is being searched at the Ministry before being sent on. They do not  mind in the slightest, for their only concern is your safety. However, it  would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them."

Harry thought he caught the words “Krum” and “can’t complain” again.
Hermione refused to sit in the common room while Ron was there, so Harry generally joined her in the library, which meant that their conversations were held in whispers.
Hermione, while the librarian, Madam Pince, prowled the shelves behind them. “I really couldn’t care less.”

and she backed out of the room, giggling. The door swung shut behind her.
Harry! Wondered where you’d got to!”
Harry! Wondered where you’d got to!”
Hermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange, feathery model of the solar system.
You shouldn’t leave Lavender waiting outside,” she said quietly. “She’ll wonder where you’ve gone.”

I’ll see you later,” he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom.
Ron marched downstairs, through the still-crowded kitchen and into the yard, and Harry kept pace with him all the way, Hermione trotting along behind them looking scared.
Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, Ron rounded on Harry.
You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around?”
You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around?
I’m not messing her around,” said Harry, as Hermione caught up with them.
  “Ron — ”
But Ron held up a hand to silence her.
She was really cut up when you ended it — ”
So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn’t because I wanted to.”
Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she’s just going to get her hopes up again — ”
She’s not an idiot, she knows it can’t happen, she’s not expecting us to — to end up married, or — ”
he could see nothing but Voldemort ahead.
“If you keep groping her every chance you get — ”
“It won’t happen again,” said Harry harshly. The day was cloudless, but he felt as though the sun had gone in. “Okay?”
“It won’t happen again,” said Harry harshly. The day was cloudless, but he felt as though the sun had gone in. “Okay?
Ron looked half resentful, half sheepish; he rocked backward and forward on his feet for a moment, then said, “Right then, well, that’s ... yeah.”
Well, does it really matter?”
Well, does it really matter?
There’s nothing in here about navy blue robes, nothing!” she said, flipping feverishly through the pages.
Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that she and Ron had been examining when Harry had entered the kitchen.
But you never told us that!”
 “Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes.
How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance?” Hermione asked, her soupspoon suspended in midair.

“And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes?” Hermione asked.

Blimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing — ”
You do realize, don’t you, that there’s probably no more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the Ministry of — ”
I think we should do it tomorrow,” said Harry.

Don’t even think about it,” Ron snarled at her.
Two masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before their wands were fully raised, Hermione shouted, “Glisseo,”
Don’t even think about it,” Ron snarled at her.
No,” said Hermione, “it makes much more sense if I take the Cloak and — ”
You two stay here, I’ll go under the Cloak and I’ll be back as soon as I — ”
Harry cut across Ron.
Right,” said Ron, squaring his shoulders. “So you can’t go, that’s what he wants, what he’s expecting. You stay here and look after Hermione, and I’ll go and get it — ”

Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he turned back to the sprouts. “Mind your own business.”

Mrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand.
Well, how did she sustain such extensive brain damage? Careful, now!”
won’t,” said Ron, “let you see,” he added under his breath, as he turned back to the sprout mountain.
A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots.
Nice,” said Ron, roaring with laughter. “Very thoughtful.”
I’d rather have them than that necklace,” said Harry, which sobered Ron up at once.
Oh yeah,” said Ron, looking down at his shoulders in vague surprise. “Sorry ... looks like we’ve all got horrible dandruff now. ...”
He brushed some of the fake snow off Hermione’s shoulder. Lavender burst into tears. Ron looked immensely guilty and turned his back on her.

We split up,” he told Harry out of the corner of his mouth. “Last night. When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with Hermione. Obviously she couldn’t see you, so she thought it had just been the two of us.”
Ah,” said Harry. “Well — you don’t mind it’s over, do you?”
Ah,” said Harry. you don’t mind it’s over, do you?”
you don’t mind it’s over, do you?”
you don’t mind it’s over, do you
No,” Ron admitted. “It was pretty bad while she was yelling, but at least I didn’t have to finish it.”
Coward,” said Hermione, though she looked amused. “Well, it was a bad night for romance all around. Ginny and Dean split up too, Harry.”
Gred
Keeping his face as immobile and his voice as indifferent as he could, he asked, “How come?”
Keeping his face as immobile
Oh, something really silly . . . She said he was always trying to help her through the portrait hole, like she couldn’t climb in herself ... but they’ve been a bit rocky for ages.”
Harry glanced over at Dean on the other side of the classroom. He certainly looked unhappy.
Of course, this puts you in a bit of a dilemma, doesn’t it?” said Hermione.
Of course, this puts you in a bit of a dilemma, doesn’t it?
What d’you mean?” said Harry quickly.
What d’you mean  said Harry quickly.

Now, now, boys,” squeaked Professor Flitwick reproachfully. “A little less talk, a little more action ... Let me see you try. ...

Together they raised their wands, concentrating with all their might, and pointed them at their flasks. Harry’s vinegar turned to ice; Ron’s flask exploded.
Yes ... for homework,” said Professor Flitwick, reemerging from under the table and pulling shards of glass out of the top of his hat, “practice.”

“ — and if you want people to help you, Ron,” added George, throwing the paper airplane at him, “I wouldn’t chuck knives at them. Just a little hint. We’re off to the village, there’s a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who thinks my card tricks are something marvelous ... almost like real magic.
No, I don’t think we can do that,” said Fred seriously. “It’s very character-building stuff, learning to peel sprouts without magic, makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs — ”
What are you two up to?” asked Ron. “Can’t you help us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then well be free too!”
What are you two up to? asked Ron. “Can’t you help us with these sprouts? You could just use your wand and then well be free too!”
Or he’s the world’s biggest prat,” said Fred, as Mrs. Weasley left the kitchen. “One of the two. Well, let’s get going, then, George.”
Mrs. Weasley turned away before she answered. “No, he’s busy, I expect, at the Ministry.”
Percy definitely not showing his ugly face, then?” asked Fred.
Percy definitely not showing his ugly face, then? asked Fred.
everyone should be comfortable. Well, they’ll have a bed, anyway
couldn’t,” said Harry. “I promised Dumbledore I wouldn’t wander off while I’m staying here.
Oh yeah,” said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then said, “Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other
Yep,” said Harry. “I’m going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it, and Dumbledore’s top of the list. I might have another word with your dad too
Pity you didn’t hear what Malfoy’s actually doing, though
couldn’t have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was refusing to tell Snape
he was just trying to find out what Malfoy’s up to
No one’s that good an actor, not even Snape
Yeah ... I’m just saying, though
You think I’m right, though
Yeah, I do!” said Ron hastily. “Seriously, I do! But they’re all convinced Snape’s in the Order, aren’t they

The three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment. Then there was a loud bang and Hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke.
Hermione!” shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash.
Hermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye
squeezed it and it — it punched me!” she gasped.
And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope.
Don’t worry,” said Ron, who was plainly trying not to laugh, “Mumll fix that, she’s good at healing minor injuries —
Oh well, never mind that now!” said Hermione hastily. “Harry, oh, Harry ...
She sat down on the edge of his bed again.
She stared at him, then whispered, “Are you scared?
Not as much as I was,” said Harry. “When I first heard it, I was . . . but now, it seems as though I always knew I’d have to face him in the end. ..
When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in person, we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy,” said Ron eagerly. “And we were kind of right, weren’t we? He wouldn’t be giving you lessons if he thought you were a goner, wouldn’t waste his time — he must think you’ve got a chance!
That’s true,” said Hermione. “I wonder what he’ll teach you, Harry? Really advanced defensive magic, probably ... powerful countercurses ... anti-jinxes
He knew that Ron and Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell them.
and evasive enchantments generally,” concluded Hermione. “Well, at least you know one lesson you’ll be having this year, that’s one more than Ron and me. I wonder when our O.W.L. results will come?

But Dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explanations.
  “It is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not interrupt me, because there is very little time,” he said quietly. “There is not a shred of proof to support Black’s story, except your word — and the word of two thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince anybody. A street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters’ Secret- Keeper.”
 “Professor Lupin can tell you — ” Harry said, unable to stop himself.
  “Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest, unable to tell anyone anything. By the time he is human again, it will be too late, Sirius will be worse than dead. I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little — and the fact that he and Sirius are old friends — ”

“I’m trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy, sir,” said Harry fiercely.
Snape stared at him.
Snape stared at him.
“Put that wand away at once,” he said curtly. “Ten points from Gryff — ”
Snape looked toward the giant hourglasses on the walls and gave a sneering smile.
“Ah. I see there are no longer any points left in the Gryffindor hourglass to take away. In that case, Potter, we will simply have to — ”

“Out of St. Mungo’s, I see!”
“Yes, Professor Snape,” said Professor McGonagall, shrugging off her traveling cloak, “I’m quite as good as new. You two — Crabbe — Goyle — ”
She beckoned them forward imperiously and they came, shuffling their large feet and looking awkward.
“take these up to my office for me.”
They turned and stumped away up the marble staircase.
What say you, Professor Snape?
Oh — well — I suppose ...
and a shower of rubies fell down into the bottom bulb of Gryffindor’s hourglass as she spoke.
Mr. Potter, I think, Professor Snape — so there we are...
A few rubies retreated into the upper bulb, leaving a respectable amount below nevertheless

“Yeah,” said Harry, “but he just attacked Snape for no good reason, just because — well, just because you said you were bored,” he finished with a slightly apologetic note in his voice.
“I’m not proud of it,” said Sirius quickly.
everyone thought they were the height of cool — if they sometimes got a bit carried away —
“If we were sometimes arrogant little berks, you mean,” said Sirius.

Harry missed the pod, hit the bowl, and shattered it.
Reparo,” he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and the bowl sprang back together again. The crash, however, appeared to have awoken Ron and Hermione to Harry’s presence. Hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of Flesh-Eating Trees of the World to find out the correct way to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the other hand, looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself
Hand that over, Harry,” said Hermione hurriedly. “It says we’re supposed to puncture them with something sharp
Harry passed her the pod in the bowl; he and Ron both snapped their goggles back over their eyes and dived, once more, for the stump.
Gotcha!” yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the stump just as Hermione managed to burst the first one open, so that the bowl was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms
Oh, Perce!” said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss him

Harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll. When he emerged from this he was sorry to find that Hermione was still in full flow about O.W.L. grades.

 “No, E,” George corrected her, “E for ‘Exceeds Expectations.’ And I’ve always thought Fred and I should’ve got E in everything, because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams

They all laughed except Hermione, who plowed on, “So after E, it’s A for ‘Acceptable,’ and that’s the last pass grade, isn’t it
Yep,” said Fred, dunking an entire roll in his soup, transferring it to his mouth, and swallowing it whole
Then you get P for ‘Poor’ ” — Ron raised both his arms in mock celebration — “and D for ‘Dreadful

Harry laughed again, though he was not sure whether or not George was joking. He imagined trying to conceal from Hermione that he had received T’s in all his O.W.L.s and immediately resolved to work harder from now on

What for?” said Harry
What for? said Harry
What for? said Harry
For thinking I can play Quidditch,” said Ron. “I’m going to resign first thing tomorrow
If you resign,” said Harry testily, “there’ll only be three players left on the team.” And when Ron looked puzzled, he said, “I’ve been given a lifetime ban. So’ve Fred and George
What?” Ron yelped.
What? Ron yelped.
Hermione told him the full story; Harry could not bear to tell it again. When she had finished, Ron looked more anguished than ever.
This is all my fault —
You didn’t make me punch Malfoy,” said Harry angrily.
if I wasn’t so lousy at Quidditch
it’s got nothing to do with that
it was that song that wound me up
it would’ve wound anyone up
Hermione got up and walked to the window, away from the argument, watching the snow swirling down against the pane.
Look, drop it, will you!” Harry burst out. “It’s bad enough without you blaming yourself for everything
Ron said nothing but sat gazing miserably at the damp hem of his robes. After a while he said in a dull voice, “This is the worst I’ve ever felt in my life
Join the club,” said Harry bitterly
Well,” said Hermione, her voice trembling slightly. “I can think of one thing that might cheer you both up
Oh yeah?” said Harry skeptically.

It had better not be clothes!” said Ron warningly. “You know what Sirius said, Kreacher knows too much, we can’t set him free!
“although if I had my way I’d certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag. No, it’s a patchwork quilt, I thought it would brighten up his bedroom
What bedroom?” said Harry, dropping his voice to a whisper as they were passing the portrait of Sirius’s mother

Harry was getting sick of telling people that Hermione wasn’t his girlfriend.
It’ll die down, though,” he told Hermione, “if we just ignore it. ... People got bored with that stuff she wrote about me last time — ”

Goyle’s mum’ll be really pleased, though,” said Ron, who had come to investigate the source of the commotion. “He’s loads betterlooking now... Anyway, Harry, the food trolley’s just stopped if you want anything
What do you mean, ‘something amusing?” he said irritably.
What do you mean, something amusing?” he said irritably.

Yeah, well, food’s one of the five exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration,” said Ron to general astonishment.

He used to be a Death Eater,” said Ron stubbornly. “And we’ve never seen proof that he really swapped sides...
Dumbledore trusts him,” Hermione repeated. “And if we can’t trust Dumbledore, we can’t trust anyone.
You’re worse than Ron
Hermione laughed
Well, wouldn’t it have been easier if she’d just asked me whether I liked her better than you
Girls don’t often ask questions like that,” said Hermione.
Then I could’ve just told her I fancy her, and she wouldn’t have had to get herself all worked up again about Cedric dying
I’m just trying to make you see how she was feeling at the time
You should write a book,” Ron told Hermione as he cut up his potatoes, “translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them
So, how was Quidditch practice
It was a nightmare,” said Ron in a surly voice.

Fred and George turned up.
We were watching their practice. They’re going to be slaughtered. They’re complete rubbish without us
Come on, Ginny’s not bad,” said George fairly, sitting down next to Fred. “Actually, I dunno how she got so good, seeing how we never let her play with us...
She’s been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you weren’t looking,” said Hermione from behind her tottering pile of Ancient Rune books.
Oh,” said George, looking mildly impressed. “Well — that’d explain it

Four on one
Harry didn’t really listen. A warmth was spreading through him that hadn’t anything to do with the sunlight. A tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving. He knew that Ron and Hermione were more shocked than they let on. But the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as if I´he were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell them.

 “this is precisely why I loathed being a teacher! Young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything. Has it not occurred to you, my poor puffed-up popinjay, that there might be an excellent reason why the headmaster of Hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plans to you? Have you never paused, while feeling hard-done-by, to note that following Dumbledore’s orders has never yet led you into harm? No. No, like all young people, you are quite sure that you alone feel and think, you alone recognize danger, you alone are the only one clever enough to realize what the Dark Lord may be planning...”

 No one can get in. Fred and George tried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut.
Someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill; moments later, Malfoy had appeared, followed closely by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy was speaking.
"... should have an owl from Father any time now. He had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm . . . about how I couldn’t use it for three months. ...”
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.

Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.
“Then it could catch the Snitch for you.”
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered.
“I really wish I could hear that great hairy moron trying to defend himself ... There’s no ’arm in ’im, ’onest — ’ . . . that hippogriff’s as good as dead — ”
Malfoy suddenly caught sight of Ron. His pale face split in a malevolent grin.
“What are you doing, Weasley?”
What are you doing, Weasley?
Malfoy looked up at the crumbling house behind Ron.
“Suppose you’d love to live here, wouldn’t you, Weasley? Dreaming about having your own bedroom? I heard your family all sleep in one room — is that true?”

Suppose you’d love to live here, wouldn’t you, Weasley? Dreaming about having your own bedroom? I heard your family all sleep in one room — is that true?
Harry seized the back of Ron’s robes to stop him from leaping on Malfoy.
“Leave him to me,” he hissed in Ron’s ear.
The opportunity was too perfect to miss. Harry crept silently around behind Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, bent down, and scooped a large handful of mud out of the path.

The whole class looked around at Harry, who hastily tried to recall what Dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit Slughorn.
I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side,” muttered Harry to Ron and Hermione.
If you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Finnigan, you would have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher.”
But sir, I heard people talking — ”

“There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with Cedric’s death,” Dumbledore went on. “I am talking, of course, about Harry Potter.”
Harry raised his head and stared at Dumbledore.
“Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish Hufflepuff house,” Dumbledore continued. “He was a good and loyal friend, a hard worker, he valued fair play. His death has affected you all, whether you knew him well or not. I think that you have the right, therefore, to know exactly how it came about.”

But no…their last hope was gone.
their last hope was gone.
But Harry had just noticed something.
Harry let out a roar of frustration.
Books can take you only so far in this field
A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage.
Harry’s misgivings increased.
He’s replaced his father as a Death Eater!
If his surroundings could have reflected the feelings inside him, the pictures would have been screaming in pain.
And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her.
With one great leap, Harry managed to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it.
Harry grinned into his pillow, exceptionally glad that Ron couldn’t see what he could.
The following morning, he paid a man to fit bars on Harry’s window.
But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later, could not think Mrs. Weasley silly.
“I seem to have touched a nerve,” said Malfoy, smirking.
He couldn’t miss it.
“He’s from Durmstrang!” spat Ron. 
“My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive.”
My answer is that my priority was to keep you alive.
And as he thought this, the scar on his forehead burned so badly that he clapped his hand to it.
the others had noticed a thing; all of them were now helping themselves to food while gloating over Harry’s narrow escape; Fred, George, and Ginny were still singing.
“Is it, already?” said Luna vaguely.
Is it, already?” said Luna vaguely
Is it, already?
I’ve been really worried and if Harry is all right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be better if you used a different owl, because I think another delivery might finish your one off.
Of course, she had preferred Cedric, he knew that… “Oh Harry, don’t you see?” Hermione breathed.
Of course, she had preferred Cedric, he knew that
“Oh Harry, don’t you see?” Hermione breathed.
Oh Harry, don’t you see?
Harry nodded curtly, but found that for some reason he did not mind Luna talking about Sirius.
Before he knew what had happened her hand was in his and she was breathing in his ear, “I’m really, really sorry. That interview was so brave…it made me cry.”

Deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents, fourteen-year-old Harry Potter thought he had found solace in his steady girlfriend at Hogwarts, Muggle-born Hermione Granger.
Deprived of love since the tragic demise of his parents,
“James, give it a rest!” said Ginny.
She stared at him, then
She stared at him, then whispered
There was no point putting in the dream; he didn’t want it to look as though he was too worried.

Harry yelled at them, snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace.

“This way,” said Mr. Weasley.
I’ll put in ten Galleons, Harry found himself thinking desperately.
 they stepped out of the stream of Ministry employees heading for the golden gates, toward a desk on the left, over which hung a sign saying SECURITY. A badly shaven wizard in peacock-blue robes looked up as they approached and put down his Daily Prophet.
“I’m escorting a visitor,” said Mr. Weasley, gesturing toward Harry.
“Step over here,” said the wizard in a bored voice.
“Step over here,” said the wizard in a bored voice.   Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down Harry’s front and back.

Ron mouthed soundlessly like a goldfish out of water as Hermione turned on her heel and stormed up the girls’ staircase to bed. Ron turned to look at Harry.
Well,” he sputtered, looking thunderstruck, “well — that just proves — completely missed the point
Harry didn’t say anything. He liked being back on speaking terms with Ron too much to speak his mind right now — but he somehow thought that Hermione had gotten the point much better than Ron had.
Everybody got up late on Boxing Day. The Gryffindor common room was much quieter than it had been lately, many yawns punctuating the lazy conversations. Hermione’s hair was bushy again; she confessed to Harry that she had used liberal amounts of Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion on it for the ball, “but it’s way too much bother to do every day,” she said matter-of-factly, scratching a purring Crookshanks behind the ears.
Ron and Hermione seemed to have reached an unspoken agreement not to discuss their argument. They were being quite friendly to each other, though oddly formal. Ron and Harry wasted no time in telling Hermione about the conversation they had overheard between Madame Maxime and Hagrid, but Hermione didn’t seem to find the news that Hagrid was a half- giant nearly as shocking as Ron did.
Well, I thought he must be,” she said, shrugging. “I knew he couldn’t be pure giant because they’re about twenty feet tall. But honestly, all this hysteria about giants. They can’t all be horrible. ... It’s the same sort of prejudice that people have toward werewolves
It’s just bigotry, isn’t it?

know, it’s just that — we promised,” said Hermione in a small voice.
Ron smoothed his hair flat again, looking preoccupied.
You think you’re such a big man, Potter,” said Malfoy, advancing now, Crabbe and Goyle flanking him. “You wait. I’ll have you. You can’t land my father in prison — ”

She’s probably cheerful enough with someone else,” said Harry, shrugging.

Who’s she with now anyway?” Ron asked Hermione, but it was Ginny who answered.
Who’s she with now anyway? Ron asked Hermione, but it was Ginny who answered.
Michael Corner,” she said.
Michael — but — ” said Ron, craning around in his seat to stare at her. “But you were going out with him!”
Ron looked highly delighted.
Well, I always thought he was a bit of an idiot,” he said, prodding his queen forward toward Harry’s quivering castle. “Good for you. Just choose someone — better — next time.”
mate
He really thought for a moment that Ron might hit him, but then something much worse happened: Ron seemed to sag on his broom; all the fight went out of him and he said, “I resign. I’m pathetic
You’re not pathetic and you’re not resigning!” said Harry fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of his robes. “You can save anything when you’re on form, it’s a mental problem you’ve got!

“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.
“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third- floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.”

It was a small roll of parchment, which Harry recognized at once as another invitation to a lesson with Dumbledore.
I’ve been told to give you this
She thrust what appeared to be a green onion, a large spotted toadstool, and a considerable amount of what looked like cat litter into Ron’s hands, finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to Harry.

He stopped talking very suddenly. Lavender Brown was standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous.
Hi,” said Ron nervously.

It was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctuated (as Snape had clearly planned) with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or Sirius’s names, usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally accompanied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew.

and Harry himself was far more interested in hearing about the tournament than in worrying about deaths that had happened hundreds of years ago.
“There have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate the tournament,” Dumbledore continued, “none of which has been very successful. However, our own departments of International Magical Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have decided the time is ripe for another attempt. We have worked hard over the summer to ensure that this time, no champion will find himself or herself in mortal danger.
“The heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving with their short-listed contenders in October, and the selection of the three champions will take place at Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for the Triwizard Cup, the glory of their school, and a thousand Galleons personal prize money.”
“I’m going for it!” Fred Weasley hissed down the table, his face lit with enthusiasm at the prospect of such glory and riches. He was not the only person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the Hogwarts champion. At every House table, Harry could see people either gazing raptly at Dumbledore, or else whispering fervently to their neighbors. But then Dumbledore spoke again, and the Hall quieted once more.
Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts,” he said, “the heads of the participating schools, along with the Ministry of Magic, have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year. Only students who are of age — that is to say, seventeen years or older — will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration. This” — Dumbledore raised his voice slightly, for several people had made noises of outrage at these words, and the Weasley twins were suddenly looking furious — “is a measure we feel is necessary, given that the tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hogwarts champion.” His light blue eyes twinkled as they flickered over Fred’s and George’s mutinous faces. “I therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under seventeen.

“Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger,”
Harry said very quickly, “Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood ... We’re here to save someone, unless your Ministry can do it first!”
“Thank you,” said the cool female voice. “Visitors, please take the badges and attach them to the front of your robes.”
Half a dozen badges slid out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. Hermione scooped them up and handed them mutely to Harry over Ginny’s head; he glanced at the topmost one.
“Visitor to the Ministry, you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk, which is located at the far end of the Atrium.”

Fawkes the phoenix looked around, his bright black eyes gleaming with reflected gold from the sunset beyond the windows. Dumbledore was standing at the window looking out at the grounds, a long, black traveling cloak in his arms.

There was silence for a while, except for the sounds of munching; then Ted spoke again.
“Not sure,” said Dean. “My dad left my mum when I was a kid. I’ve got no proof he was a wizard, though.”
“Muggle-born, eh?” asked the first man.

“Yeah,” said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at each other, silent but beside themselves with excitement, sure they recognized the voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow Gryffindor.
“Knew they were coming for me,” replied mellow- voiced Ted, and Harry suddenly knew who he was: Tonks’s father. “Heard Death Eaters were in the area last week and decided I’d better run for it. Refused to register as a Muggle-born on principle, see, so I knew it was a matter of time, knew I’d have to leave in the end. My wife should be okay, she’s pure-blood. And then I met Dean here, what, a few days ago, son?”

And then I met Dean here, what, a few days ago, son?
“Six weeks ... seven ... I forget,” said the tired man. “Met up with Griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with Gornuk not long after. Nice to have a bit of company.” There was a pause, while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground. “What made you leave, Ted?” continued the man.

“So, you three have been on the run how long?” asked a new, mellow, and pleasant voice; itwas vaguely familiar to Harry, who pictured a round-bellied, cheerful-faced man.

“Thank you,” said the goblins together in English.
Goblins, Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded.
“Here, Griphook, Gornuk.”
A fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas; large shadows passed between tent and flames. The delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tantalizingly in their direction. Then came the clinking of cutlery on plates, and the first man spoke again.
There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh. Somebody grunted appreciatively. Harry pressed the Extendable Ear deeper into his own: Over the murmur of the river he could make out more voices, but they were not speaking English or any human language he had ever heard. It was a rough and unmelodious tongue, a string of rattling, guttural noises, and there seemed to be two speakers, one with a slightly lower, slower voice than the other.

Anyone else’s parents got a problem with Harry?” he said aggressively.

She says you need to talk to Sirius?

She looked rather taken aback by this thoughtfulness
Harry can have his chat with Sirius
how is Harry supposed to talk to him
“Umbridge’s office,” said Harry quietly
only fire that was not being watched was her own.
said Hermione in a hushed voice.
Ron had lowered his leaflet on jobs in the cultivated fungus trade and was watching the conversation warily.

And how are you going to get in there in the first place
Harry was ready for this question.

If you want to worry about anyone, Hermione, worry about me
Why should I be worried about you

How did you get away?” asked Harry in amazement, taking his wand from Ron.

Dumbledore I wouldn’t wander off while I’m staying here
Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and Malfoy saying to each other
another word with your dad too
Malfoy’s actually doing, though
he was refusing to tell Snape
he was just trying to find out what Malfoy’s up to
No one’s that good an actor, not even Snape
I’m just saying, though
You think I’m right, though
But they’re all convinced Snape’s in the Order, aren’t they
he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he’s doing.

The fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry could tell would be filled with water at high tide.

The water was icy; Harry’s waterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down.
And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumbledore slid from the boulder, landed in the sea, and began to swim, with a perfect breaststroke, toward the dark slit in the rock face, his lit wand held in his teeth. 
“Then take off your Invisibility Cloak — there is no need for it now — and let us take the plunge.”
“No,” said Harry.
“You will not object to getting a little wet?”
You will not object to getting a little wet?
“You see?” said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand a little higher. Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was swirling.

Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched down as Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. His expression unfathomable, he returned to the party. Harry remained on the floor, hidden beneath the cloak, his mind racing.

Very slowly, his arms trembling, the man on the ground raised his shoulders a few inches and lifted his head. His face was bloodstained and gaunt, twisted in pain yet rigid with defiance...
“Lord Voldemort is waiting...”
The man on the floor let out a scream of pain, attempted to stand but fell back, writhing. Harry was laughing. He raised his wand, the curse lifted, and the figure groaned and became motionless.
The black shape upon the floor shifted a little. Harry saw a long-fingered white hand clutching a wand rise on the end of his own arm . . . heard the high, cold voice say, “ Cruciol ”
A voice issued from his own mouth, a high, cold voice empty of any human kindness, “Take it for me... Lift it down, now... I cannot touch it ... but you can...”
But there was a shape on the floor at the very end, a black shape moving upon the floor like a wounded animal... Harry’s stomach contracted with fear ... with excitement...
Once again he was in the cathedral-sized room full of shelves and glass spheres... His heart was beating very fast now... He was going to get there this time... When he reached number ninety-seven he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two rows...
He jogged the last few feet to the third door, which swung open just like the others...
Straight across the stone floor and through the second door . . . patches of dancing light on the walls and floor and that odd mechanical clicking, but no time to explore, he must hurry...
He was walking along the cool, dark corridor to the Department of Mysteries again, walking with a firm and purposeful tread, breaking occasionally into a run, determined to reach his destination at last... The black door swung open for him as usual, and here he was in the circular room with its many doors...
And nobody from Liechtenstein had wanted to come Think, he told himself, his face in his hands, while all around him quills scratched out never-ending answers and the sand trickled through the hourglass at the front...

ery few people know that Lord Voldemort was once called Tom Riddle. I taught him myself, fifty years ago, at Hogwarts. He disappeared after leaving the school… traveled far and wide… sank so deeply into the Dark Arts, consorted with the very worst of our kind, underwent so many dangerous, magical transformations, that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recognizable. Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever, handsome boy who was once Head Boy here.
