<p>Potter Search (https://potter-search.com/) is a website that lets you search through the text of all 7 Harry Potter books.</p>

<p><strong>The New Update</strong></p>

<p>You can share your searches now!</p>

<p>For example, https://www.potter-search.com/?search=harry%27s+face will take you to Potter Search and automatically search “Harry’s face.”</p>

<p>Each time you make a search on Potter Search, the URL will update and you just have to copy it to share it.</p>

<p>More examples - taking some of the searches suggested by this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jcl4jo/i_made_a_tool_for_searching_the_7_harry_potter/g937mkw/">comment</a>:</p>

<p>“Greater good” Dumbledore - turns out, all the occurrences of the phrase “greater good” are in DH, and are either directly related to Dumbledore’s past w/ Grindelwald and not the present, or are Aberforth still being upset about said past</p>

<p>https://www.potter-search.com/?search=Greater+good</p>

<p>Lemon drop addict Dumbledore - not true, Dumbledore appears to only once offer a lemon drop to someone. Other occurrences are when they are (or were) the password for his office.</p>

<p>https://www.potter-search.com/?search=lemon+drop</p>

<p>Harry my boy, my boy Harry, my boy, etc… - Said by Wood (after they win a Quidditch match), Trelawney, and Hagrid. Never Dumbledore. At least, never with the two words adjacent to each other like that.</p>

<p>https://www.potter-search.com/?search=my+boy</p>

<p>This makes searches easier to share!</p>

<p><strong>What’s Next</strong></p>

<p>I’ve been dedicating more time to improving Potter Search. The next major task will be adding other texts to the tool and making the searching better (for example, using quotes to directly match something). I would also be open to any suggestions!</p>

<p>Search term has been collected from March 3rd, 2022 to now (October 2, 2022). It’s been 7 months. Other user data was collected by Google Analytics since the beginning (October 15, 2020)</p>

<p><strong>Quick Facts</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>There’s been <strong>81,864 queries</strong> in the last 7 months.</li>
  <li>There’s been <strong>over 7000 Potter Search users</strong> since its launch. The most users in a single day was over 1,100 users (this was very early on when the Reddit posts were first posted).</li>
  <li>At the time of this writing, there were <strong>123 unique users on Potter Search in the past week</strong>.</li>
  <li>The average user spends just over a minute on Potter Search.</li>
  <li><strong>People have tried to hack Potter Search!</strong> There’s <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp">SQL injection attacks</a> (luckily, Potter Search does not use SQL), and Python code pasted into the search bar.</li>

<p>I made this for a side project and hopefully it will help book discussions around the community! The inspiration for this tool came when I wanted to find the scene where Harry sees Snape’s memories, and Snapes shows Dumbledore his Patronus. It hits hard every time.</p>
