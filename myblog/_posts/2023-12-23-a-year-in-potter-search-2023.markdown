**What is Potter Search?**

Potter Search (https://potter-search.com/) is a website that lets you search through the text of all 7 Harry Potter books.

**The New Update**

You can share your searches now!

For example, https://www.potter-search.com/?search=harry%27s+face will take you to Potter Search and automatically search "Harry's face."

Each time you make a search on Potter Search, the URL will update and you just have to copy it to share it.

More examples - taking some of the searches suggested by this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jcl4jo/i_made_a_tool_for_searching_the_7_harry_potter/g937mkw/):

"Greater good" Dumbledore - turns out, all the occurrences of the phrase "greater good" are in DH, and are either directly related to Dumbledore's past w/ Grindelwald and not the present, or are Aberforth still being upset about said past

https://www.potter-search.com/?search=Greater+good

Lemon drop addict Dumbledore - not true, Dumbledore appears to only once offer a lemon drop to someone. Other occurrences are when they are (or were) the password for his office.

https://www.potter-search.com/?search=lemon+drop

Harry my boy, my boy Harry, my boy, etc... - Said by Wood (after they win a Quidditch match), Trelawney, and Hagrid. Never Dumbledore. At least, never with the two words adjacent to each other like that.

https://www.potter-search.com/?search=my+boy

This makes searches easier to share!

**What's Next**

I've been dedicating more time to improving Potter Search. The next major task will be adding other texts to the tool and making the searching better (for example, using quotes to directly match something). I would also be open to any suggestions!

**Search Term Stats**
