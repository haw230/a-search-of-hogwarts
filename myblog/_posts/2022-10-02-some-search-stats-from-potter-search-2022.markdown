Hey folks, we’re just two weeks away from the 2nd birthday of [Potter Search](https://potter-search.com/) (a website for searching all 7 Harry Potter books at once), and I decided to compile some stats as a sort of celebration. A few months back I decided to collect some search term data since it’s pretty interesting to see what people are searching with Potter Search.

Search term has been collected from March 3rd, 2022 to now (October 2, 2022). It’s been 7 months. Other user data was collected by Google Analytics since the beginning (October 15, 2020)

**Quick Facts**

* There’s been **81,864 queries** in the last 7 months.
* There’s been **over 7000 Potter Search users** since its launch. The most users in a single day was over 1,100 users (this was very early on when the Reddit posts were first posted).
* At the time of this writing, there were **123 unique users on Potter Search in the past week**.
* The average user spends just over a minute on Potter Search.
* **People have tried to hack Potter Search!** There’s [SQL injection attacks](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp) (luckily, Potter Search does not use SQL), and Python code pasted into the search bar.


**Top 10 Most Searched Terms**
