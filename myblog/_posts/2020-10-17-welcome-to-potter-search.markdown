I made this for a side project and hopefully it will help book discussions around the community! The inspiration for this tool came when I wanted to find the scene where Harry sees Snape's memories, and Snapes shows Dumbledore his Patronus. It hits hard every time.

Some fun search terms:

* [Uranus](https://www.potter-search.com/?search=uranus) (just to see some fun scenes)

* [Pocketed it](https://www.potter-search.com/?search=pocketed+it) (apparently Stephen Fry, the narrator for the audio books, had trouble pronouncing "pocketed it" so J.K. Rowling made sure to include the phrase in every book to troll him)

* [Slimy Slytherins](https://www.potter-search.com/?search=Slimy+Slytherins) (ron never says this)

* Pretty much any spell ([lumos](https://www.potter-search.com/?search=lumos), [expelliarmus](https://www.potter-search.com/?search=expelliarmus) etc)

* The ghosts ([Fat Friar](https://www.potter-search.com/?search=Fat+Friar), [Peeves](https://www.potter-search.com/?search=Peeves))

* [Greater good](https://www.potter-search.com/?search=Greater+good) (never mentioned until Deathly Hallows!)

* [My boy Harry](https://www.potter-search.com/?search=My+boy+Harry) (Dumbledore never says this!)

* [Lemon drop](https://www.potter-search.com/?search=Lemon+drop)
